# SAMv2

The [SAMv2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2) (and v2.1) models are a follow-up to the original [Segment-Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) models, with a focus on faster execution and reduced memory requirements. [Like SAMv1](https://github.com/heyoeyo/muggled_sam/tree/main/lib/v1_sam), the v2 models act like a more intelligent form of a magic wand tool for segmenting parts of an image based on user-provided prompts. Additionally, SAMv2 introduces support for video segmentation, which is able to automatically propagate a starting segmentation through frames of a video, tracking objects as the move or change in appearance.

More details to come! (WIP)
